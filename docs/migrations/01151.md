# Purpose

The Pagination component was refactored to reuse the `Select` component for its dropdown element. The change only effects you if you used overrides.

## Pagination

- `StyledDropdownMenu` export was removed
- `StyledDropdownButton` export was removed
- `overrides` prop changes:
  - `DropdownButton` override was removed
  - `DropdownMenu` override was removed
  - `Select` override was added. Please note that `Select` identifier in the pagination overrides object is for a component and not a styled element. Refer to the API of the [`Select` component](https://baseweb.design/components/select/) for the full list of its props.

```diff
- import {StyledDropdownMenu} from 'baseui/select';
- import {StyledDropdownButton} from 'baseui/select';

  <StatefulPagination
    numPages={10}
    overrides={{
-     DropdownButton: {props: {kind: KIND.secondary}},
-     DropdownMenu: {style: {width: '300px'}},
    }}
  />
```
